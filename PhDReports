Arthur has made a solid start to his Ph.D. research programme with the AP
group. After an initial deliberation to balance common research interests and
scientific impact, we settled on a medium-term project to explore spherical
overdensity evolution in modified theories of gravity, in the context of
cosmological structure formation and black hole solutions. The ideal outcome of
the project will be a theory-agnostic computer algebra pipeline for finding new
solutions and (qualitatively) constraining models. The time-horizon for this
project is 6-8 months in total, and is expected to produce at least one
publication in the one-year time frame (coinciding with the first year report).

Arthur has made very rapid progress in learning the Wolfram Language, and
getting to grips with the xAct software -- both from a cold start. He is
fortunate to have some prior experience with vim and scientific computing.
Simultaneously, Arthur has made good inroads into a review of the scientific
literature, having read and understood the key papers on Einstein--Aether
theory, and reproduced certain calculations by hand.

Arthur attends weekly in-person meetings with the PI at a scheduled time on
Fridays, which Dr. Barker and Professor Lasenby are joining in a supporting
role. Arthur has made use of extensive, proactive email exchanges with all
three co-supervisors in his investigations. 

Arthur has also begun to fill his undergraduate teaching quota this term. He is
also a regular attendee of the `[gr-qc] arXiv scrolling' journal club, which
the group holds on Thursdays.

(Augmenting WH report)

...despite promising theoretical suggestions from previous work. Importantly,
these investigations will reveal whether the previous work incorporated a
conceptual error in the implications of the fundamental theory for the physical
cosmology and observational effects. This would be an important, positive
contribution to the literature, supplementing the potential null result.

...based on whether they are capable of forming stars or the observed compact
objects which we take to be black holes.
