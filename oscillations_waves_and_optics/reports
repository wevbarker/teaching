Adam has worked very hard this term, and made excellent progress. Adam frequently asks questions about the physics, at the level which will be relevant to the exam. His written work is very solid, so I have no long-term concerns.

Note that Adam is the only member of the cohort to have consistently submitted work this term!

Archie has worked hard this term. We usually have a few minutes while the rest of his group migrates from a different supervision room in which to review the week's lectures. I have no concerns with his understanding of the OWO course, but I wonder if he would not benefit from tackling some of the (admittedly less enjoyable) Experimental Methods examples.

I will also take a look at an assessed practical report for Archie over the coming week.

Lukas has worked very hard this term, and is clearly an excellent physicist.  His questions during the supervision are usually at a level which is well above the OWO course. I have no concerns whatever regarding the exam.

Jacob has worked very hard this term, and is clearly an excellent physicist.  His questions during the supervision are usually at a level which is well above the OWO course. I have no concerns whatever regarding the exam.

Haoyu has worked very hard this term, and has an excellent grasp of the OWO course. I hope that as we enter the quantum mechanics course (and leave the `optics' and other non-physics content behind) he will find the content more interesting.
