Archie has made good progress with the quantum physics course. He is good at leading the supervisions by asking about those questions which bother him the most. I get the sense that some progress has been made this way during our contact time. I think Archie has enjoyed quantum mechanics more than the Michaelmas OWO course, I'd strongly encourage him to try thorough attempts at those questions which were highlighted in the supervisions, if he has not already done so. Archie performed pretty well during the mock exam, relative to the cohort: the grade should not be over-interpreted since one question was non-tripos. Archie is toying with the idea of switching to Astrophysics next year: I'm happy to discuss the routes with him further so as to optimise his enjoyment of the rest of Tripos, or to put him in touch with the powers that be. Note: overall progress with quantum physics has been hindered this term by the progression of the lectures.

Haoyu has been attentive during supervisions this term. I was a little concerned by his performance during the mock exam, relative to the cohort: the grade should not be over-interpreted since one question was non-tripos. However I sensed that there was a lack of performance even on the `bookwork' aspects which may indicate a lack of preparation, and a lot of time practicing his copperplate script in the whitespace of the exam paper. If that criticism is fair, then it needs nailing down very firmly during the Easter vacation for success during the final exams. Haoyu responds well in discussions of the physics, and I'm confident that he grasps the principles of the QP course.

Adam has persisted with his zealous diligence throughout the quantum physics course. He remains by far the most reliable submitter of work, and I am satisfied that he is making excellent progress. Adam proactively asks for help on key topics during supervisions. Note: overall progress with quantum physics has been hindered this term by the progression of the lectures.

#  Lukas  #

Lukas has progressed very well during the quantum physics course. There was one point where we needed a clarification of the fundamental postulates, i.e. superposition of states and the role of measurement, but beyond that I am happy that he understands the course and how to solve the problem sheets. It is a pleasure to discuss the course content with him during supervisions. It appears Lukas and Jacob, supervision partners, have taken to prematurely self-teaching the Easter term condensed matter course during the latter weeks of Lent: this is a great idea, and bodes well for the exams. Note: overall progress with quantum physics has been hindered this term by the progression of the lectures.

Jacob appears to have had no problems whatever with the quantum physics course, except those which he creates for himself by picking apart the lies/mistruths introduced to simplify the course. It is a pity his first introduction to quantum physics could not have been through the Maths tripos, where things are done more professionally. It is a pleasure to interact with Jacob during supervisions, and I anticipate no issues with his final grades whatever. I am somewhat curious about Jacob's plans for Part II, since he is the kind of candidate who would really thrive in the TP1/2 route -- this may be a point to discuss in the end-of-year DoS meetings.
